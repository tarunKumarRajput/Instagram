# ðŸ“£Instagram - Summary
Instagram Clone in aim to get full knowledge of react and how react works.

I have build this application form scratch using react, tailwind css and firebase. Instagram clone is built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard & lastly the user profile page. Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

Currently you can like, comment, follow and unfollow in this app . The features that i am adding very soon in this app are update profile, post and chat feature with your followers. Give it a star if you liked this project.
